==Are there any pre-packaged JAR files I can download?==
    Pre-built JAR files are available on the [https://github.com/nhatminhle/cofoja/releases GitHub release page].

==What do I need in order to use Cofoja?==
    Java 6 or higher and a recent version of the [http://asm.ow2.org ASM library]. See the [https://github.com/nhatminhle/cofoja#dependencies README.md section on dependencies] for specific versions and instructions.

==How is this better than using assert?==
  * Contracts are inherited from superclasses and interfaces.
  * Inherited contracts can be extended, but only within the limits imposed by the superclass -- as in the Liskov substitution principle.
  * {{{@Ensures}}} can use the {{{old}}} keyword to refer to the state at the start of the method, e.g. {{{@Ensures("size() == old(size()) + 1")}}}.
  * {{{@Invariant}}} adds checks to every public method.
  * {{{@ThrowEnsures}}} adds checks about conditions when an exception is thrown.
  * Disabled by default -- so you can and should write expensive checks. Can be enabled all at once or selectively, i.e. just for a particular library or group of libraries.
  * Clean separation of assumptions and guarantees from the actual method code. The annotations become part of the javadoc.

==Is this framework related to '!ModernJass' from Sourceforge.net?==
    Yes, Cofoja is a significant rewrite of !ModernJass. We worked closely with the original author of !ModernJass (Johannes Rieken) on this.

==Is code annotated with contracts slower than code not annotated?==
    If runtime checking is enabled, yes. If runtime checking is disable the code is as fast as if there were no annotations.

==Is the contract code compiled? I only see strings in annotations!==
    The annotation processor takes care of compiling the strings into bytecode and runs along the Java compiler, so you get static syntax and typing errors at compile time, as usual.

==Is there any IDE support yet?==
    Not yet. The eclipse plugin from the !ModernJass sourceforge.net page is obsolete. Let us know if you would like to help! 

==What about debugger support?==
   Contracts for Java adds standard debugging information, such as source file and line numbers, to contract code. Debugging has been tested under JDB, Eclipse and IntelliJ (using remote debugging); only Eclipse has issues with setting breakpoints on contract annotations (source correspondence and step-by-step debugging works, though).

==Is the source code of Contracts for Java annotated with contracts? (I.e. are you eating your own dogfood?)==
    Yes, all the classes in Cofoja that could bear contracts have been contracted; some classes needed at run time cannot be annotated because of technical reasons. New classes are only added to the project with proper contracts.
