 * annotated method must establish its postconditions if and only if
 * the preconditions were satisfied.
 *
 * <p>When run time checking of contracts is enabled, exceptional
 * postconditions are checked at method exit, when the method exits by
 * throwing an exception, and throw a
 * {@link com.google.java.contract.PostconditionError} when they are violated.
